# MasterReactJS - 1 month - Until July 31th

> ## "If not today, so when you accomplish your tasks?"
> ## "Self-discipline is the ability to make yourself do what you should do, when you should do it, whether you feel like it or not."

This repository serves as the central hub for our code and the official guideline for our accelerated ReactJS learning plan for the final project. All members are required to read this document carefully and strictly adhere to the rules.

## üéØ Main Objective

- To complete 100% of the 132-video ReactJS playlist by Coder Stoic and gain a solid understanding of its core concepts by the end of July.
- Watch all 132 videos aboout ReactJS from [Code Stoic](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSsAz5wf2lkK_ekd0J__44KG6QoXetZza).
- You don't have to stick to the 132-video playlist. The goal is to learn from any resource necessary to be able to code well in ReactJS.
- Achieve proficiency in ReactJS. 

## üöÄ Daily Workflow Plan

1.  Daily Quota: Each member must study and practice 5 videos from the playlist every day until July 31th.
2.  Mandatory Daily Reporting: Reporting is non-negotiable and must be done daily after completing the quota.
How to Report: You can comment directly in the code or create a REPORT.md file inside the corresponding day's folder.
Report Content: Follow this format clearly:
Generated code
- Video [##] - [Video Title]: Key takeaways, core concepts learned (e.g., props, state, hooks...).
Code Submission: git push all practice code from the day's 5 videos to the appropriate folder in this repository.
3.  Learning Approach: When facing challenges or new concepts relating to ReactJS, proactively research official documentation like the Official [React Docs](https://react.dev/) or [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/REACT/DEFAULT.ASP).
4.  Discipline: Each member is allowed a maximum of 2 rest days during the entire plan. Taking 3 days off in a row will result in a review and may lead to removal from the team before the final project starts.

## üìú  Rules & Consequences

*   Adherence to this learning plan is the minimum requirement to remain a part of the final project team in first semester.
*   Warning: Any member who fails to comply with these rules or meet the objectives without a valid reason will be reported to the instructor and removed from the team.
