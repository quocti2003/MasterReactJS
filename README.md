üéØ The Mission
Our primary objective is to transition from learners to proficient ReactJS developers by July 31st. This is achieved by:
Completing the Core Curriculum: Master the entire 132-video ReactJS playlist by Coder Stoic.
Achieving True Proficiency: The playlist is our roadmap, not our limit. The ultimate goal is to code effectively in ReactJS. This requires going beyond the videos and actively seeking knowledge from other resources.
üöÄ Daily Protocol
Success is built on daily habits. The following protocol is mandatory.
Daily Quota
Study and practice a minimum of 5 videos from the playlist each day.
Daily Reporting
How: Create a REPORT.md file inside your daily folder (e.g., Day-01/REPORT.md) or comment directly in your code.
Format: Use the following structure for clarity:
Generated markdown
### Video [##] - [Video Title]
- **Key Concept:** [e.g., Props, State, Hooks, Context API]
- **Learnings:** [A brief summary of what you learned and how you applied it.]
- **Challenges:** [Any difficulties encountered and how you solved them.]
Use code with caution.
Markdown
Submission: Commit and push all new code and reports to your personal branch at the end of each day.
Learning Strategy
When you encounter a challenge, become a problem-solver. Consult official documentation first:
Official React Docs
W3Schools React Tutorial
Discipline
A maximum of 2 rest days are permitted throughout the entire month.
Taking 3 consecutive days off is unacceptable and will result in immediate removal from the project team.
üìÇ Git Workflow & Collaboration Protocol
To maintain a clean and organized codebase, we will adhere to a strict Git workflow. Direct pushes to the main branch are forbidden.
Gain Repository Access
Send the email address associated with your GitHub account to the team lead. You will be added as a collaborator.
Create Your Personal Branch
Once you have access, clone the repository and create your own branch from main. Do not work on the main branch.
Your branch must follow the naming convention: name-branch (e.g., hieu-branch, huy-branch, toan-branch).
Generated bash
# Clone the repository (only do this once)
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_name>

# Create and switch to your new branch
git checkout -b yourname-branch
Use code with caution.
Bash
Work and Push to Your Branch
All your work‚Äîcode, notes, and daily reports‚Äîmust be committed and pushed exclusively to your personal branch.
Generated bash
# After making changes...
git add .
git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message"
git push -u origin yourname-branch
Use code with caution.
Bash
Rule of Thumb: Each member is responsible for their own branch. Do not push to anyone else's branch or to main.
üìú Rules & Consequences
Commitment: Adherence to this plan is the non-negotiable minimum requirement to remain on the final project team.
Accountability: Any member who fails to meet these objectives without a valid, pre-communicated reason will be reported to the instructor and removed from the team. No exceptions.
üõ†Ô∏è Arsenal (Tools & Resources)
Primary Curriculum: 132 Videos ReactJS Tutorials by Coder Stoic
Version Control & Reporting: This GitHub Repository.
Knowledge Base: Official React Docs
P.S. Master the basic Git commands: git add, git commit, git push. They are your tools for submitting work. Let's crush this goal together!
