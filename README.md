  <p><i>"Self-discipline is the ability to make yourself do what you should do, when you should do it, whether you feel like it or not."</i></p>

<!-- INTRODUCTION -->
<p>
  This repository is the command center for our accelerated ReactJS learning mission. Its purpose is to track progress, enforce discipline, and ensure every member is prepared for the final project. <strong>Read and adhere to these guidelines.</strong>
</p>

<!-- THE MISSION SECTION -->
<h2>üéØ The Mission</h2>
<p>Our primary objective is to transition from learners to proficient ReactJS developers by <strong>July 31st</strong>. This is achieved by:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Completing the Core Curriculum:</strong> Master the entire <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSsAz5wf2lkK_ekd0J__44KG6QoXetZza">132-video ReactJS playlist by Coder Stoic</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Achieving True Proficiency:</strong> The playlist is our roadmap, not our limit. The ultimate goal is to <strong>code effectively in ReactJS</strong>. This requires going beyond the videos and actively seeking knowledge from other resources.</li>
</ol>

<!-- DAILY PROTOCOL SECTION -->
<h2>üöÄ Daily Protocol</h2>
<p>Success is built on daily habits. The following protocol is <strong>mandatory</strong>.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>1. Daily Quota</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Study and practice a minimum of <strong>5 videos</strong> from the playlist each day.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>2. Daily Reporting</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>How:</strong> Create a <code>REPORT.md</code> file inside your daily folder (e.g., <code>Day-01/REPORT.md</code>) or comment directly in your code.</li>
      <li><strong>Format:</strong> Use the following structure for clarity:</li>
      <pre><code>### Video [##] - [Video Title]
- **Key Concept:** [e.g., Props, State, Hooks, Context API]
- **Learnings:** [A brief summary of what you learned and how you applied it.]
- **Challenges:** [Any difficulties encountered and how you solved them.]</code></pre>
      <li><strong>Submission:</strong> Commit and push all new code and reports to your personal branch <strong>at the end of each day</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>3. Learning Strategy</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>When you encounter a challenge, become a problem-solver. Consult official documentation first:
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://react.dev/"><strong>Official React Docs</strong></a></li>
          <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/react/"><strong>W3Schools React Tutorial</strong></a></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>4. Discipline</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>A maximum of <strong>2 rest days</strong> are permitted throughout the entire month.</li>
      <li>Taking <strong>3 consecutive days off</strong> is unacceptable and will result in immediate removal from the project team.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<!-- GIT WORKFLOW SECTION -->
<h2>üìÇ Git Workflow & Collaboration Protocol</h2>
<p>To maintain a clean and organized codebase, we will adhere to a strict Git workflow. <strong>Direct pushes to the <code>main</code> branch are forbidden.</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Gain Repository Access</strong>
    <p>Send the email address associated with your GitHub account to the team lead. You will be added as a collaborator.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Create Your Personal Branch</strong>
    <p>Once you have access, clone the repository and create your own branch from <code>main</code>. <strong>Do not work on the <code>main</code> branch.</strong> Your branch must follow the naming convention: <code>name-branch</code> (e.g., <code>hieu-branch</code>, <code>huy-branch</code>, <code>toan-branch</code>).</p>
    <pre><code class="lang-bash"># Clone the repository (only do this once)
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_name>

# Create and switch to your new branch
git checkout -b yourname-branch</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Work and Push to Your Branch</strong>
    <p>All your work‚Äîcode, notes, and daily reports‚Äîmust be committed and pushed exclusively to <strong>your personal branch</strong>.</p>
    <pre><code class="lang-bash"># After making changes...
git add .
git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message"
git push -u origin yourname-branch</code></pre>
  </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Rule of Thumb:</strong> Each member is responsible for their own branch. Do not push to anyone else's branch or to <code>main</code>.</p>

<!-- RULES & CONSEQUENCES SECTION -->
<h2>üìú Rules & Consequences</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Commitment:</strong> Adherence to this plan is the <strong>non-negotiable minimum requirement</strong> to remain on the final project team.</li>
  <li><strong>Accountability:</strong> Any member who fails to meet these objectives without a valid, pre-communicated reason <strong>will be reported to the instructor and removed from the team.</strong> No exceptions.</li>
</ul>

<!-- TOOLS & RESOURCES SECTION -->
<h2>üõ†Ô∏è Arsenal (Tools & Resources)</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Primary Curriculum:</strong> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSsAz5wf2lkK_ekd0J__44KG6QoXetZza">132 Videos ReactJS Tutorials by Coder Stoic</a></li>
  <li><strong>Version Control & Reporting:</strong> This GitHub Repository.</li>
  <li><strong>Knowledge Base:</strong> <a href="https://react.dev/">Official React Docs</a></li>
</ul>
